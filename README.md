## üöÄ What Drives Me

The decentralized future excites me. The promise of **blockchain technology** to disrupt industries and create new economic models fuels my learning journey. In addition to building decentralized applications and smart contracts, I am passionate about **blockchain security**.
- **Ownership & Transparency:** Blockchain enables true ownership and transparency, removing the need for trusted intermediaries.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** The ability to revolutionize finance by making it accessible to everyone, anywhere.
- **NFTs & Digital Identity:** Empowering creators and individuals to own and monetize their digital identity and assets.
- **Web3 Integration with IoT:** Leveraging my experience in embedded systems, I see great potential in integrating IoT devices with blockchain for secure, decentralized control and data management.
- In my free time, I conduct **shadow audits** on smart contract security contests, where I focus on identifying vulnerabilities and improving the security of Solidity contracts. This allows me to stay sharp and up-to-date with the latest security practices and challenges in the Web3 space.

## üîê Security Audits & Shadow Audits

I am actively involved in the Web3 security space by conducting **shadow audits** during smart contract security contests. Through these audits, I:
- Analyze Solidity code for vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflows/underflows, and improper access control.
- Follow industry best practices to understand and mitigate risks in decentralized applications (dApps).
- Stay up-to-date with the latest attack vectors and security innovations in the blockchain ecosystem.

This hands-on approach to security has enhanced my ability to write more secure and robust smart contracts while deepening my understanding of **Web3 security standards**.


## üå± Currently Learning

I am committed to continuous learning and improvement. Here's what I'm currently focusing on:
- Advanced **Solidity** techniques (security best practices, gas optimization)
- Building and deploying full-stack **dApps**
- Exploring **Zero Knowledge Proofs** (zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs) for enhanced privacy
- Studying **Layer 2 scaling solutions** (Optimistic Rollups, zk-Rollups)

## üíº Web3 Projects

### 1. **Merkle-Airdrop**
A decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to claim their allocated tokens by verifying their eligibility using a Merkle proof, ensuring efficient and secure distribution. Built with Solidity for the smart contract and Foundry for tests.

- **Tech Stack:** Solidity, Foundry
- **Goal:** To The Merkle Airdrop solves the problem of efficiently and securely distributing tokens to a large number of users by minimizing on-chain data storage and gas costs, while ensuring that only eligible users can claim their allocated tokens through cryptographic proofs using decentralized technologies.

### 2. **DeFi-Stablecoin**
A decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to mint and redeem a stablecoin pegged to USD, backed by overcollateralized crypto assets, and maintains its stability algorithmically. Built with Solidity for the smart contracts and Foundry for tests.

- **Tech Stack:** Solidity, Foundry
- **Goal:** The DeFi-Stablecoin solves the problem of creating a decentralized, algorithmically stable cryptocurrency that is pegged to the US dollar, ensuring stability through overcollateralization and automated mechanisms, without reliance on centralized entities.
